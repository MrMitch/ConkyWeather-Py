# ConkyGoogleWeather

Since Weather.com closed the free access to their API, the conkyweather extension for [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) doesn't work anymore.

This a Python (>= 2.7) script to retrieve weather informations using the Google API, designed to be used in [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) to solve that "_problem_".

It's not fully functional at the moment but you can still get a preview of what it can do by cloning the repository.  
All you have to do, is opening a terminal in the directory you just cloned into and type ```./main.py``` or ```./main.py Paris``` or ```./main.py 'New york' i``` for example.

Last improvements are in the ```develop``` branch.
