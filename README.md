# ConkyWeather-Py

Since Weather.com closed the free access to their API, the ```conkyforecast``` extension for [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) doesn't work anymore.

**ConkyWeather-Py** is a Python (2.7) script to retrieve weather informations from other free APIs available on the Internet, designed to be used in [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) to solve that "_problem_".

Currently supported APIs are:

* Google API
* WeatherUnderground API

With those two APIs working, the next line on the TODO list is **writing a documentation**, explaining how to to use it with Conky (i.e. its main goal...) and providing explicit examples (YAY!).   
(I know this is important, but you know, writing code is far more funnier, so I can't give any ETA)

More APIs can be expected after that.

Last improvements are in the ```develop``` branch.
